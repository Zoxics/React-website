Welcome to my custom-built React portfolio website — a fusion of creativity, code, and dark mode construction-paper aesthetics.

### Stack & Tools

- React + TypeScript
- Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (animations)
- Marked & Front Matter (Markdown rendering)
- EmailJS (form submission)
- Sonner Toast (feedback UI)

### Notable Features

- **Sticky Note Commit Display** – grabs my latest GitHub commit via the GitHub API and displays it like a pinned memo
- **Redacted Text UI** – custom blackout effects for "classified" information using styled spans
- **Markdown Projects** – each project is a `.md` file auto-loaded and rendered with animations
- **Fully Responsive** – looks clean across desktop and mobile

### Contact System

The contact form integrates with EmailJS and gives toast feedback for success or error. All sensitive keys are stored securely via `.env`.
