      I'm a computer science student passionate about all things tech. As I
      enter the programming field, my interests are focused on artificial
      intelligence and cybersecurity—two areas where innovation meets critical
      problem-solving. I’m detail-driven, curious, and always eager to learn
      more about how technology shapes our world. Whether I'm writing code or
      exploring new systems, I bring a deep fascination and determination to
      everything I do.
